    "description": "Vast and cinematic, this famed national park is an absolute showstopper, with bands of red rocks and carved canyon walls as far as the eye can see. No wonder it draws millions of visitors every year. But if you want solo time in nature, you’re in luck. The window of December to February gets only a sliver of summer’s peak crowds. Yes, it’s cold—highs tend to hover around 45 degrees—but this season has its own attractions, like seeing the Canyon’s walls dusted in snow. South Rim trails also stay open for the most part. One good bet: The Hermit Trail tends to stay relatively snow- and ice-free because of its lower elevation and sunlight exposure. Need another reason to come? January is also when the park’s historic photo studio, Kolb Studio, has its art exhibition and sale.",

Food lovers can spend a lifetime sampling the city’s pasta—impossibly buttery cacio e pepe, rich and meaty carbonara. Art fanatics can tour masterpiece after masterpiece by the likes of Michelangelo and Raphael. And history buffs can explore an absurd amount of ancient sites, from the Pantheon to the Colosseum to the Trevi Fountain. But just when you think you have Rome figured out, it surprises you. Just look at its nightlife, which rivals any European capital with its up-all-night energy and legendary clubbing. And even if your bar-crawl days are behind you, it’s worth joining locals in the Roman tradition of an aperitivo (pre-dinner drink) to toast this eternal city.",

His iconic creations, like the jaw-dropping Basilica of La Sagrada Familia, are instantly recognizable and have fueled millions of travel dreams.
